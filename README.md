🏙️ Moscow Apartment Price Prediction
    
    This project is part of my machine learning coursework. The goal was to predict apartment prices in Moscow using a dataset of over 33,000 listings with 30+ features (location, building type, size, etc.).

📌 Task

    Build a regression model to predict apartment prices using real-world data.
